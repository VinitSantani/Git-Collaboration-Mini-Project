### *Note from the authors*:
This was a completely new concept for the both of us. We previously studied Business as a part of our undergrad so we had little to no coding or technical experience prior, but this mini project and all the [resources we used](Resources_used.md) helped us really understand more about git and software engineering in general! It took us a couple tries, but was very satisfying when we first successfully pushed and pulled code from the github repo using our code editors and their built in terminals.
