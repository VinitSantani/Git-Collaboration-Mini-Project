# Git Terminology and Commands
1. **Repository**: This is a storage area where your projects can live. It can store code, text, images, and anything else that your project may need. This is also sometimes shorthanded as “repo” and can be stored either in an online platform like git hub or locally to your pc.
2. **Clone**: *git clone*  is essentially downloading a local copy of a repo that is hosted somewhere else. For example, cloning a github repo to your local PC
3. **Fork**: Forking allows you to branch off from the master branch and develop a new feature without impacting your main code.
