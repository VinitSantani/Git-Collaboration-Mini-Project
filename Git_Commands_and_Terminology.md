# Git Terminology and Commands
1. **Repository**: This is a storage area where your projects can live. It can store code, text, images, and anything else that your project may need. This is also sometimes shorthanded as “repo” and can be stored either in an online platform like git hub or locally to your pc.
2. **Clone**: *git clone*  is essentially downloading a local copy of a repo that is hosted somewhere else. For example, cloning a github repo to your local PC
3. **Fork**: Forking allows you to branch off from the master branch and develop a new feature without impacting your main code.
4. **Branch**: *git branch* is basically a duplication of code in a new parallel area. Your master branch is the default and then you can branch off from that. When you are ready to add a feature you can merge the feature branch back with the master branch
5. **Commit**: *git commit* saves the changes to your file in git and pushes them to your main repository
6. **Merge**: *git merge* automatically compiles your code from your new feature branch and merges it with the master branch. It will ensure that no lines of code are written over- if so it will show a merge conflict at which point you can make the necessary changes
7. **Git Checkout**: *git checkout* lets you navigate between the branches created by git branch. Checking out a branch updates the files in the working directory to match the version stored in that branch, and it tells Git to record all new commits on that branch.
8. **Git Push**: *git push* is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo. It's the counterpart to git fetch , but whereas fetching imports commits to local branches, pushing exports commits to remote branches.
