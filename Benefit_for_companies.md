# What are Git, Docker, Automated Testing, and Continuous Integration and why are they important for a company?

## Terms
**GIT**:
Git is a distributed version control system developed by Linux Founder Linus Torvalds. It allows for much easier and faster collaboration within a company.

**Docker**:
Docker is a set of PaaS products which use virtualization to break up software into separate containers. Essentially, this allows companies to build microservices by breaking up one large PC into multiple smaller PCs with their own well defined channels for communication.

**Automated Testing**:
Automated testing is testing using a tool rather than having a whole human resource wasting their time repeating the same task over and over again. This enables the human to take on higher value tasks and leaves the more tedious tasks to the automation tools.

**Continuous Integration**:
Continuous Integration is the priciple of collaborators merging their code to a main branch several times per day. This helps reduce major errors and allows you to backtrack to the most recent working copy of code. 

## How do these technologies improve the productivity and competitiveness of a company?
Essentially, these technologies help with collaboration and will eliminate duplicated efforts. They allow multiple developers in a company to work on multiple features at the same time, without stepping over one anotherâ€™s toes in.
